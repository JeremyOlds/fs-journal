# CSharp

in console:
  dotnet - base commands in cmd to start doing dotnet projects.
    new console - creates a basic file setup for csharp program
    run - runs the csharp file to see what it will do.

csharp is like c++, a strictname coding. some examples of different types of variables:
char - character
string - string 
int - integer, whole numbers
double - decimal point numbers
float - 
bool - boolean data type

bang (!) operator still wotks in csharp
if statements require a bool or something that results in a bool. there is no truthy/falsey logic.

list<data type of your choosing> - creates a list of whatever you choose
Example: list<string> names = new list<string>()

foreach - for loop exists still with different syntax
example: foreach(string name in names)
{
  code go here
}

string interpolation exists but the $ must be outside the quotes.
example: Console.WriteLine($"insert text here {interpolated things here}")

namespace- acts as our export for c#
using - acts as our import system


readonly - equivilant of a const from javascript
